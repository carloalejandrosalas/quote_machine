# Quote machine
*Freecodecamp project*

## What is it?
This is an app that gives you an quote and its author. You can press an button for give you other quote, 
or other button for tweet the quote.

## Why did I do it?
I did it because... I like challenges and with this project I learn more tecnics of Jquery and Js and how use APIs. After
this project I had never used an API. But right now I can use it without any problem.

## How did I do this?
To did this I use Jquery, Js and an API by [dmakk767](https://github.com/dmakk767) that gives you quotes from influential persons. 
Anyway here is the link to the [quote API](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dmakk767/9375ff01aff76f1788aead1df9a66338/raw/491f8c2e91b7d3b8f1c8230e32d9c9bc1a1adfa6/Quotes.json%2520) 
if you want to see or use it
